# The Purpose of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to convince W. Avy, a famous surfer, to invest my business plan in Hawaii.  My plan is the open an ice cream shop with surf gear, called "Surf n' Shake Shop" on the island of Oahu. 

He wants to be prepared by knowing the weather history and pattern in the area. To be able to obtain the information I used SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask along with Python and Jupyter Notebook. I was able to provide the temperatrure statistics for june and december as he requested to see if this business would be good opportunity to invest.

#Results

From the statistics above we can say:

* December's min temperature is 56F colder than June's which is 64F 
* June's max temperature 85F is not much hotter than December's which is 83F
* The median temperature between both months is within the 70s, with June's being 75F, and December being 71F.

#Summary

Regarding the results we have above, we can say that Surf and Ice Cream shop could be sustainable all year round.
